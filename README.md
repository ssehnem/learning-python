# 🐍 Learning Python

Welcome to my Python learning journey!
This repository is a collection of my projects, exercises, and notes as I explore Python — from the basics to more complex topics.

## 🚀 About This Repository

I'm currently learning Python with a focus on:

* Programming fundamentals
* Data manipulation (pandas, NumPy)
* Data visualization (matplotlib, seaborn)
* Data Science
* Web scraping
* Automation
* Problem solving and mini-projects

This repo includes:

* 🧩 Simple practice scripts
* 📂 Organized folders by topics
* 📈 Beginner-friendly data projects
* 🛠️ Work-in-progress code (yes, even the messy parts — that’s how we grow!)

## 📌 Goals

* Build a solid Python foundation
* Practice writing clean and readable code
* Document my learning progress
* Create projects I can later include in a professional portfolio
* Learn more about data analysis and data science 

## 🙌 Contributions & Feedback

This is a personal learning space, but if you have any suggestions, ideas, or just want to say hi — feel free to open an issue or leave a comment!

## 🌟 Future Plans

* Learn and apply object-oriented programming (OOP)
* Work on real datasets
* Transition into more data science-focused projects
* Create a personal portfolio with my best projects

## 📝 Notes

Some of this code may be basic, unfinished, or experimental — and that’s okay, small steps are also steps.
